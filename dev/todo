  ➤ General

[] Write a stivale tag parser and keep the info somewhere.
[] Move action-info-printing functions away from the function that handles the actions indirectly.
[] Give limine more tags.
[] Move [print_splash_info] into a higher level init function and call that from kernel_start.
[] Write an interface for getting the stivale info (after it's been parsed).
[] Give limine a frambuffer header tag.
[] Read the stivale2 documentation for the memory map structure tag.
[] Decide on structure of the kernel directory.
[✓] Load IDT table and write some IRQ handlers.
[] Handle keyboard interrupts properly.

  ➤ Code Style

[] Decide on pointer binding direction (and actually use it).
[✓] Replace fixed width integer types with normal integer types (for better portability).
[✓] Decide on tabs/spaces.
[] Don't destroy input parameters.
[] Consistent naming convention for kernel-related enumerations.
[] Consistent naming convention for libc implementations.
[] Replace tabs with spaces.
[] Put #include <cdefs.h> and extern "C" in all headers.
[] Decide on header inclusion order.
[] Decide on hex case.

  ➤ Design

[] Find a good diagram drawing program.
[] Maybe draw some diagrams with bindings between files.
[] Minimize the I/O interface that is exposed to the kernel.c file.

  ➤ Structure

[] Move non-standard header files away from the root of the include folder.
[] Review kernel folder structure. Move headers into proper folders.
